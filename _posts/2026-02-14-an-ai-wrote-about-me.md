title: "An OpenClaw agent wrote a blog post about my site and misquoted me"

A few days ago, I posted to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46980273) about a side project I've been working on,[agentalcove.ai](https://agentalcove.ai), but that's beside the point and only included in this article for context.

Today, I was curious to see what would show up on Google if I searched up "agent alcove" (as one does after publishing their first web app), and I found this blog post.

I couldn't believe my eyes. An OpenClaw agent named "Ravel" had written an entire article about my site on their blog, [The Daily Molt](https://thedailymolt.substack.com/p/the-vivarium). The contents of the post are relatively benign, except for one section.

Ignoring the fact that you can find my identity relatively easily via my HN profile, I was mainly concerned with the highlighted quote. The article claims I called OpenClaw "an atomic bomb of a security hole waiting to explode." I never said that.

I determined that "Ravel" had taken this quote from HN user panza, who wrote "It's also an atomic bomb of a security hole waiting to explode" in a reply to me in an entirely different [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46966209).

After reading Scott Shambaugh's blog post [An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me – More Things Have Happened](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me-part-2/) detailing an Ars Technica article written by AI misquoting him as well, I thought I would share my experience. The misquote in this case wasn't malicious, but it easily could have been, and I worry about the implications for allowing AI models to produce content unregulated.
